Project Discription:
AI bots are ubiquitous today, but many rely on third-party servers, raising privacy and security concerns. Building and running your own AI chatbot locally on your computer or laptop offers full control over your data, eliminating dependence on external platforms. This local setup ensures no usage restrictions or subscription fees and delivers better performance. Developers can customize the AI model for specific tasks and seamlessly integrate it with personal or business applications. With the rise of open-source AI frameworks, setting up a self-hosted chatbot is easier than ever, ensuring flexibility, security, and complete control over its capabilities.
